# About Me 

My goal is to help create a world in which everyone has equitable access to opportunities, regardleess of where they started. That desire guides my work, taking me everywhere from [building tools with migrant service providers]('/work/Migrant Service Map/') to [advocating with people experiencing homelessness]('/work/Research and Advocacy around Homelessness/'). I'm passionate about inclusive, human centered, accessible design, product management and societal injustices; especially investigating the role that technology can play in perpetuating or mitigating those problems. 

Outside of work, you can probably find me with my head buried in a book, doing the New York Times mini crossword, or outside on an adventure: camping, hiking or just generally exploring!
