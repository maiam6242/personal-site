# About Me 

My goal is to help create a world in which everyone has equitable access to opportunities, regardless of where they started. This desire guides my work, taking me everywhere from [<span> building tools with migrant service providers </span>](/work/Migrant%20Service%20Map/) to [<span>advocating with people experiencing homelessness</span>](/work/Research%20and%20Advocacy%20around%20Homelessness/). I'm excited about inclusive, human centered, accessible design as well as product management. I'm particularly passionate about working around societal injustices, especially investigating the role that technology plays in these issues. Currently, I'm [<span>contracting with the NIH</span>](/work/NCATS) and looking for summer opportunities.

Outside of work, you can probably find me with my head buried in a book, doing the New York Times mini crossword, or on an outdoor adventure: camping, hiking or just generally exploring! Please [<span>reach out</span>](/contact/) if you'd like to chat!
